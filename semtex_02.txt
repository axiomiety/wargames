the encrypt fn can take 10 to 20 letters from A-Z.
for a text of size 10, the aglorithm seems to be well defined
AAAAAAAAAA,AZZZYYXWVT
BBBBBBBBBB,BAAAZZYXWU
CCCCCCCCCC,CBBBAAZYXV

however a soon as the size increases (eg, 11), we get:
AAAAAAAAAAA,UNSNQMWKSHO
BBBBBBBBBBB,VOTORNXLTIP
CCCCCCCCCCC,WPUPSOYMUJQ

from this we deduct the cypher is actually length-dependent

the encrypted text is HRXDZNWEAWWCP which is of length 13.

going with this:
AAAAAAAAAAAAA,AXMDNNPKTEKUL
BBBBBBBBBBBBB,BYNEOOQLUFLVM
CCCCCCCCCCCCC,CZOFPPRMVGMWN

we see there is the pattern below: 
01  -> +0
02  -> +23
03  -> +12
04  -> +3
05  -> +13
06  -> +13
07  -> +15
08  -> +10
09  -> +19
10  -> +4
11  -> +10
12  -> +20
13  -> +11

however we notice that:
AAAAAAAAAAAAB,BXMDNNPKTEKUL

notice how changing the last letter to B also changed the first letter. so what we thought was a shift could simply be a swap of the last letter with the first:
BAAAAAAAAAAAC,CXMDNNPKTELUL

so:
AAAAAAAAAAAAA,AXMDNNPKTEKUL
AAAAAAAAAAAAB,BXMDNNPKTEKUL
BAAAAAAAAAAAC,CXMDNNPKTELUL

at this point it becomes clear that this is not simply a shift cypher. instead the position of the letter in the clear text changes in the encrypted text, and gets shifted.

AAAAAAAAAAAAB,BXMDNNPKTEKUL
AAAAAAAAAAABC,CXMDNOPKTEKUL
AAAAAAAAAABAC,CXMDNNPKUEKUL
AAAAAAAAABAAC,CXMENNPKTEKUL
AAAAAAAABAAAC,CXMDNNQKTEKUL
AAAAAAABAAAAC,CYMDNNPKTEKUL
AAAAAABAAAAAC,CXMDONPKTEKUL
AAAAABAAAAAAC,CXMDNNPKTEKVL

note: it is worth reminding ourselves that for each shift, we are changing 2 letters. this isn't as intuitive, so let us try again...

AAAAAAAAAAAAA,AXMDNNPKTEKUL
AAAAAAAAAAAAB,BXMDNNPKTEKUL
AAAAAAAAAAABB,BXMDNOPKTEKUL
AAAAAAAAAABBB,BXMDNOPKUEKUL
AAAAAAAAABBBB,BXMENOPKUEKUL
AAAAAAAABBBBB,BXMENOQKUEKUL 
AAAAAAABBBBBB,BYMENOQKUEKUL 
AAAAAABBBBBBB,BYMEOOQKUEKUL 
AAAAABBBBBBBB,BYMEOOQKUEKVL 
AAAABBBBBBBBB,BYNEOOQKUEKVL 
AAABBBBBBBBBB,BYNEOOQKUFKVL 
AABBBBBBBBBBB,BYNEOOQKUFKVM
ABBBBBBBBBBBB,BYNEOOQLUFKVM
BBBBBBBBBBBBB,BYNEOOQLUFLVM

posn  -> (posn,offset)
13    -> (1,0)
12    -> (6,13)
11    -> (9,19)
10    -> (4,3)
09    -> (7,15)
08    -> (2,23)
07    -> (5,13)
06    -> (12,20)
05    -> (3,12)
04    -> (10,4)
03    -> (13,11)
02    -> (8,10)
01    -> (11,12)

so to reverse the key, we just count backwards and replace the letters accordingly:
1234567890123
HRXDZNWEAWWCP
MUESLIMUHAHAH

note: i probably got some of the offsets wrong. had to finish the above using a bit of trial and error on 2 or 3 letters. but once you know the posns, working the rest out is straight forward
